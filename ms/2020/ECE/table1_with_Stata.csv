7,semantics intuitive,functions to fit meta-analyses corresponds to data type intuitive,fitting meta-analyses logic is similar to GLM fitting in R,workflow described in manual aligns with best practices in meta-analysis literature
8,functions that get the job done,most major data types have a specific function and there is also a generalized metagen function,requires clear specification in arguments but rma function is a very general yet flexible tool,"reasonable collection of features and functions to fit different meta-analyses, tools to explore bias and heterogeneity"
9,arguments to support your needs,there is an sm argument for specification of summary measures within meta-analysis functions,extensive breadth in capacity to specify model fitting,standard set of tools to explore synthesis data
